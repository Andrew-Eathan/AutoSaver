# AutoSaver v1.1
tiny customizable and interactive program that tells you to save your stuff (or it can do it for you!)  
idea by my friend Cioss, i made it into a real program  
  
features:  
- has sounds
- overlays in the top left when it tells you to save
- hotkeys to cancel save / toggle autosave on/off
- ability to choose what programs to tick the timer on (so that it doesn't try to autosave in firefox or something lol)
- hot minimal UI

usage:
- set seconds between saves to whatever you want
- turn "press ctrl+s for me" on/off depending on what you want
- click on programs in the left list to add them to the autosaving list at the right
- press the enable checkbox (or press ctrl + alt + s)
