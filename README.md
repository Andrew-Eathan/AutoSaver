# AutoSaver
tiny customizable and interactive program that tells you to save your stuff (or it can do it for you!)  
  
features:  
- has sounds
- overlays in the top left when it tells you to save
- hotkeys to cancel save / toggle autosave on/off
- ability to choose what programs to tick the timer on (so that it doesn't try to autosave in firefox or something lol)
- hot minimal UI
